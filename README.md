# Records Backend

This project is an NodeJS backend enabling to manage a vinyl record collection (in fact mine... :). 

It can be used with the following Angular frontend available at https://github.com/StephUgo/recordsfrontend.

The main functions are :
  - Create / Read / Update and Delete (CRUD) records according to a simple model (Title, Artist, Label, Style, Keywords, Reference #, Attached Pics, ...) ;
  - Search records with several criteria ;
  - Fill studio and recording information.

The software stack used for this development is quite straightforward, mainly : 
  - NodeJS ;
  - Express ;
  - JSONWebToken ;
  - MongoDB ;
  - Mongoose ;
  - Multer.
